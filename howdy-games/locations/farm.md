# üè† Farm

This is the place to **stake your** [**farmer**](../characters/farmer.md)**.**\
****Staking/Locking your Farmer is also the first & only way to aquire $POTATO until our [Farm Girls](../characters/farm-girl.md) & [Arena](arena.md) are launched.&#x20;

\
You have **3 options** to stake your farmer:

1. Normal Staking (no locking) - **10 $POTATO** / day
2. Lock for 50 days - **12 $POTATO** / day&#x20;
3. Lock for 100 days - **15 $POTATO** / day

If you decide to **lock** your farmers, you will still get all the $POTATO rewards constantly, you just cannot transfer/sell the farmers for the time being.&#x20;

**Important: You will still be able to do all in-game activities, even if your farmer is staked/locked.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The locking durations and rewards can be adjusted with time.&#x20;

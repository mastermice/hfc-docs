3. 500 $POTATO
4. 250 $POTATO
5. 100 $POTATO

### 1v1 MODE&#x20;

Fight other players. You can choose to play for fun or bet $POTATO / other assets against your opponents. You can also choose to just visit the arena as a visitor and bet $POTATO on another fight. 10% of the bet goes to the winning chicken.

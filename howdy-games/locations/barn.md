# 🐣 Barn

This is the place to generate the animals you need for the games.

You will be able to breed all the different animals solely with the $POTATO you generated by staking your farmer.&#x20;

**Important**: **ALL animals will have their own mini-game or different utility.**&#x20;

You can get a overview of the breeding costs and how much $POTATO they can earn by playing the game -> in [Animals](../characters/animals/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Breeding costs and game rewards can be adjusted with time.&#x20;

# Renting

#### The "Howdy Games" rental system will be implemented by using delegations. Scholars will never be able to do anything besides playing the game.&#x20;

Everything will happen on a trustless basis. \
More detailed information about the technology & mechanics will be introduced later. \
The renting system will be implemented **after** the [Arena](locations/arena.md).

### 1. Manager/Scholar System

Negotiate the share/price directly.&#x20;



### 2. Fixed Price

The owner can put his characters onto the market for any price (eg. 0.5 $POTATO / day) \
Players can decide to take it or not. There is no minimum or maximum price, the market will decide the fair price itself.&#x20;



### 3. Fixed Share

Players can rent your characters for free. The owner decides the share, players have the choice to take it or not (eg. 80% manager / 20% scholar).&#x20;

# Land

Our "[**Real Estate Agency**](locations/real-estate-agency.md)" will be introduced in **Q1 22.**&#x20;

## Become a landlord in the metaverse.

You will be able to **buy** your own "[**Land**](land.md)". \
Being a landlord **increases** the **assets** you can produce. You can **lend** your farm **to other farmers** and get a **share** of their **earnings** on top.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Your [**honesty** ](../gameplay/skills/honesty.md)**skill** improves your share.
{% endhint %}

## There will only ever be 250 Land.

**Only available** if you **lock** a farmer for at least **one year & burn 250 POTATO.**

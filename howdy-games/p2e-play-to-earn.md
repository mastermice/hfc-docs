  "Howdy Games"?

# P2E (play-to-earn)

There are **different ways of earning $POTATO** by playing the "Howdy Games".&#x20;

Since we have **many different game aspects** and sections, you are not only able to yield $POTATO by playing the different mini games.&#x20;

The following things show a good overview of all future possibilities:&#x20;

## Staking

Some of the characters can be staked and give you a passive return in $POTATO. \
All other game sections can still be played and used, even if your characters are staked. There is no reason not stake your NFTs, which can give you the following returns daily:

10-15 $POTATO / Farmer \
5-7 $POTATO / Farmer Girl \
5 $POTATO / Donkey \
20 $POTATO / Land

## Breeding

By holding a farmer from the beginning you will be able to generate enough $POTATO to breed your first characters. Every character has different utility. You can choose to play with your characters, trade them, or even rent them out for other players later on. Maximizing the amount of your breedings is important and is one of the first „play-to-earn“ aspects.

[Farm Girls ](characters/farm-girl.md)\
[Chickens ](characters/animals/chicken.md)\
[Pig ](characters/animals/pig.md)\
[Cow ](characters/animals/cow.md)\
[Donkey](characters/animals/donkey.md)\
[Land](land.md)\
\
All of those NFTs can be obtained **for free** if you are participating in the "Howdy Games" from the start. The only thing you will need on top of farmers is $POTATO, which you generate for free by staking your farmer.&#x20;

## Gaming

There are different games you can play in order to earn $POTATO. \
We only disclose the **Looting**, **Chicken Fights** & **Wheel of Fortune** for now.&#x20;

There will be more game modes in the future, giving you even more possibilities to earn $POTATO or rent out your characters to other players!&#x20;

#### 1v1 MODE&#x20;

Fight other players. You can choose to play for fun or bet $POTATO against your opponents.&#x20;

**Mechanics**: Both players have to bet the same amount of $POTATO. \
